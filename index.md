# Zarian Iqbal's First CS193 Homework

- One thing I love about CS193 is how it is in the evening, so I get less time later in the day to do other things
- Another thing I love about CS193 is how it is an hour long class, since I absolutely love to code
- Lastly, I like how CS193 is very challenging and is teaching me difficult topics that would take me a while to learn
